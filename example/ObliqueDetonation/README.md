## Oblique detonation

When the premixed gas of fuel and oxidizer passes through an oblique shock wave, 
the high temperature and high pressure generated after the wave forms a combustion wave,
and the combustion wave and the shock wave couple with each other to form an oblique shock wave,
which realizes high efficiency combustion within a very short time and space distance.
It can be applied to hypersonic power systems flying at high Mach numbers.
